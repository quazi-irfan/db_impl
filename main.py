# each interactino with db is a transaction
# concurrency manager interleaves the regulation of transactions from different clients
# recovery manager write record of those transactions in a log so uncommited transactions can be recovered

# file system allows accessing raw disk in blocks.
# in db, each file is treated like a raw disk
# db access each file by virtual blocks(OR translates these blocks into physical blocks using file system)
# db reads block into pages
# db maintain a pool of pages in memory
# db read and write is done on those poled pages
# By only operating in memory, db can control when writing to disk is happening
# Each table, table index and db log are stored in a single file
